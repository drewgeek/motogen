                            Most 4X4’s have never had their oils changed. Most differentials are built tough and mostly forgotten to be serviced. A 4X4 or 4matic or Quattro,all mean the same thing, usually has a front and back axle and a transfer case right along the middle of the car -all connected by the propeller shaft. Most mechanic workshops either don't remember to advice the an axle service. We are here to supply.

                        <p>
                        SUVs and Auto workshops have to  service the front and rear differential in the SUV because. Remanufacturing is to make as closely to new as possible. Components are carefully inspected, checked against original equipment measured specifications for correct dimensional tolerances and precisely rebuilt and remanufactured. Replacement parts are new or Used that requalified to meet exacting standards and tolerances.

                                Bearings are preloaded to OEM standard which provides for longer bearing life along with the unit’s smooth operation and its proper break-in.

                                Differentials are inspected for correct backlash clearance. This inspection is performed to assure proper gear lubrication for reduced noise and to avoid overheating, especially important in severe-duty applications.

                                Tooth contact pattern is inspected and adjusted to utilize the full structure of the gear. This procedure assures minimum gear noise and reduced gear fatigue.
