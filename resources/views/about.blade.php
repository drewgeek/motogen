                                  <strong>USED ENGINES</strong>
                                  <p>Used engines are taken directly from a vehicle typically a junkyard vehicle. There are no provisions for disassembly, internal cleaning, or inspection with a used component. Many used or junkyard components may have high mileage and a poor maintenance history – a failure waiting to happen. Many used or junkyard components come from a vehicle that was involved in an accident and may have unseen damage.</p>
                                  
                                  <strong>REBUILT ENGINES</strong>
                                  <p>To rebuild is to recondition by cleaning, inspecting and replacing severely worn or broken parts. Serviceable parts are reused within the manufacturer’s acceptable wear limits. The quality of rebuilt components vary widely and many come with only a short-term warranty.</p>

                                  <p>To remanufacture is to make as closely to new as possible. All core material – head and block castings, crankshaft, camshaft and rods - are carefully inspected, checked against original equipment measured specifications for correct dimensional tolerances and precisely machined. Replacement parts are new or requalified to meet exacting standards and tolerances.</p>
